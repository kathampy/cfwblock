CFW Folder Blocker v1.1

Some new UMDs detect files in the ms0:/seplugins & ms0:/iso folders and start acting up, or even delete files from these folders. This is completely unfair to homebrew users who run CFW.

This plugin will hide these folders in GAME mode so they can't be accessed.

This will not bypass any anti-ISO protection in games. It is for the protection of your files on your Memory Stick. Use the original UMD and such games will work fine and your files will also be safe.

To install, copy cfwblock.prx to ms0:/seplugins and make an entry in game.txt
e.g. ms0:/seplugins/cfwblock.prx 1
