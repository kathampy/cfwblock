CFW Folder Blocker v1.1

Some new UMDs are detecting files in the ms0:/seplugins and ms0:/iso folders and causing problems, even deleting files from these folders.

This plugin will hide these folders in GAME mode so they can't be accessed.

This will NOT bypass any anti-ISO protection in games. It is for the protection of YOUR files on YOUR memory stick. Use the original UMD and it will work fine, and your files are also safe.

To install, copy cfwblock.prx to ms0:/seplugins and make an entry in game.txt
e.g. ms0:/seplugins/cfwblock.prx 1
